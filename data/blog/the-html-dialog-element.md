Dialog boxes have been used by almost all websites for showing confirmation messages, error messages, alerts, and many more; the native support for these features in the browser is really exciting.

The Dialog element is a new HTML5 element to create dialogs such as pop-ups, modals, alerts, and more. This may be no new feature for the Javascript users who could have done this with a simple UI library. But keep in mind that it comes out of the box with Browser native support i.e. no hassle for extra add-ons.

Though the &lt;dialog&gt; element was introduced a long ago, it was not fully supported by major browsers such as Chrome. Recently, In May 2023 Google announced support for the HTML5 dialog element in Chrome-97 including all web platforms. 

The HTML5 dialog element provides the following built-in features.

- Focus management for dialog
- Tab tracking
- Keeping pop-ups stacking context

We can define the Dialog element on our HTML simply using the **dialog** keyword. Here is a sample code for defining a dialog element.

```html
<dialog id="mydialog">
        <form method="dialog">
            <p>Hi, This is a dialog box</p>
            <button>Ok</button>
        </form>
 </dialog>
```

Once we have defined our dialog element now we can simply trigger the dialog by referencing the dialog **element ID** and using the **showModal** method provided by the dialog element. 

```html
<button onclick="mydialog.showModal()">
        Open Dialog Box
</button>
```

We can also close the dialog using the close method of the dialog element.

```html
<button onclick="mydialog.close()">
            Close
 </button>
```

We can also define a dialog that opens by default when a page loads using the **open** attribute of the dialog element.

```html
<dialog open>
<p>Welcome, User!</p>
<form method="dialog">
	<button>OK</button>
</form>
</dialog>
```
